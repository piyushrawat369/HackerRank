we are adding sum to a[p] and adding negative sum at a[q+1]. which make sure that when you add element from a[p] to a[q] sum is added 
only once and it should be subtracted at a[q+1] as this sum span from p to q only. Rest array element are either 0 or some other input 
sum. max of addition will be output. refer to above code for p, q, and sum.
